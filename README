Caveats
-------

Due to code refactoring in project http://github/ochafik/nativelibs4java/, in
particular on projects ScalaCL  and Scalaxy, we may face crashes when compiling
or executing the code in this projects.

There's not much we can do at the moment, unless picking a version which works
well at the time of this build. Once we are using 0.3-SNAPSHOT, a future update
on the snapshot may break compilation or execution of this project.

Ideally we should choose a release version, but release 0.2 is still to incipient
to be considered for serious purposes.
